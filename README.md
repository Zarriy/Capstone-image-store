# Capstone Image Store Project
### About Project
  - This Project is from Scrimba Advanced React curriculum. I have created a Image store with features like adding image to favourites and removing them, showing
  of icons upon hovering on image, adding to the cart and updating the cart functionality. I used Vite + React because of its fast rendering servers and 
  optimizing build. You can check its live preview down.
